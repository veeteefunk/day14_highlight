            belongs to. Then, the uniforms support the way that schools should 
            work nowadays. In addition, if all pupils wear the school uniform, 
            there will not be any pupils who will be unfashionable, and nobody 
            will feel uncomfortable. Fashion is very popular, especially in 
            high school, and wearing fashionable clothes is the way to show 
            off. Thatâ€™s such a waste because fashion is the thing that cannot 
            be kept for a long time. It Is not a good idea to flow fashion 
            in school time.
